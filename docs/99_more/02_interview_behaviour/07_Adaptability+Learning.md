| **Step**                                      | **Approach**                                                                                                                                          |

| ✔️ **1. Depends on type of technology**       | My approach varies based on whether it's a new language, framework, or concept.                                                                       |
| ✔️ **2. Learning a new programming language** | - Compare it with known languages (Java, Python, TypeScript)<br>- Understand syntax, typing, memory model<br>- Analyze how it handles common patterns |
| ✔️ **3. Learning a new framework/library**    | - Identify the problem it solves<br>- Understand the abstraction it provides<br>- Explore what it hides under the hood                                |
| ✔️ **4. Learning strategy**                   | - Follow a structured and focused path<br>- Avoid information overload<br>- Choose 1–2 quality resources (blogs, videos, docs) and stick to them      |
| ✔️ **5. Practice and Reinforcement**          | - Build small projects or POCs<br>- Learn by doing<br>- Set aside time regularly to go deep<br>- Reinforce by applying and practicing consistently    |


### 1. project most proud-of
- what took you achieve that accomplishment 👈🏻
- not the accomplishment

| **STAR Element** | **Answer**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **✔️ Situation** | We worked on modernizing a legacy TACT system, which was monolithic, hard to scale, tightly coupled, and had frequent performance and stability issues. It ran only on mainframes.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **✔️ Task**      | I was responsible for building the **interface module**, which had:<br>🔸 **Inbound module** — data pipeline to process small CSV files from S3 (used PySpark)<br>🔸 **Outbound module** — event-driven microservices using SQS, EventBridge, SNS, Lambda, Java/Python APIs, and RDBMS schema design                                                                      |
| **✔️ Action**    | - Developed **stateless REST APIs** using Java/Python + Spring Boot<br>- Built **event-driven architecture** using SQS, EventBridge, and Lambda<br>- Implemented **distributed tracing** using OpenTelemetry and X-Ray<br>- Used **Aurora Serverless** with read replicas for performance<br>- Set up **DR strategy** and automated deployments using Terraform + Harness |
| **✔️ Result**    | The system became scalable, observable, and cloud-native. It improved my skills in **system design**, **AWS architecture**, and **cross-team collaboration**.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
