- Designed API contracts for partner integrations
- Defined relational data models for inbound/outbound modules
- Created Disaster Recovery (DR) execution plans
- Designed security architecture (OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect) and certificate management (Venafi TLS, ACM)
- Helm chart design for Kubernetes deployments and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code


### 3. **Development**

- Backend:
    - Python (FastAPI, PySpark, SQLAlchemy)
    - Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring Security)
    - PL/SQL and complex SQL queries
    - Event-driven programming with AWS services (SQS, SNS, EventBridge)
    - Kafka, RabbitMQ, IBM MQ messaging systems
- Frontend:
    - Angular (v12 to 17), RxJS, NgRx (Redux pattern)
    - Angular Material, SCSS, HTML5
- Containerization:
    - Docker images creation, Kubernetes Helm charts
- Migration and Technology Upgrades:
    - Java version upgrades (7 → 11)
    - Framework upgrades (Struts2 → Spring Boot, Hibernate v3 → v5)
    - Flash to Angular migration
- Performance Optimizations:
    - SQL tuning, caching strategies, batching, eager loading
    - Java profiling and heap optimizations
- Developed tools: Java Swing simulator for SWIFT messages


### 4. **Testing**

- Unit Testing (including code reviews and mentoring)
- API Testing with Postman and SmartBear tools
- Creation of simulation tools for integration testing
- Participated in Agile sprint reviews and retrospectives for quality assurance


### 5. **Deployment**

- CI/CD Pipeline:
    - Harness SaaS, AWS CodePipeline, Bamboo build jobs, XLDeploy
    - Kubernetes multi-tenant EKS cluster provisioning with Terraform, Helm charts
    - Container orchestration on ECS, EKS
- Infrastructure as Code:
    - AWS CDK, CloudFormation, Terraform
- Cloud environment setup:
    - Networking (VPC, ALB, Route 53), Security (IAM, KMS, ACM)
- Automated deployment of microservices and frontend applications


### 6. **Maintenance \& Support**

- Production Support:
    - Incident response, monitoring, and root cause analysis
    - Debugging and replication of issues in lower environments
    - Remediation of vulnerabilities flagged by Wiz and Snyk scans
    - Performance monitoring with CloudWatch, Datadog, xMatters
- Release coordination and version control management (Bitbucket, Bamboo)
- Migration support:
    - Messaging system migration from RabbitMQ → Kafka
    - API platform integrations and cloud migration initiatives


### 7. **Documentation \& Process**

- Technical documentation in Confluence
- Agile/Scrum practices:
    - Daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives
- Code reviews and mentoring junior/offshore engineers

This mind map organizes your work according to typical SDLC phases reflecting your full-stack, cloud-native, Agile-driven engineering background with strong DevOps experience.
