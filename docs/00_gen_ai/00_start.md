| Problem Type                           | Use...           |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Fixed rules, business logic            | Code/Service/API |
| Prediction, classification, generation | AI/ML Model      |

## ✅ When to Use Service/API
```
Problem has clear rules, business logic, or deterministic behavior

Input → predictable processing → output

Examples:
    Validate email, calculate tax, apply discount rules
    CRUD operations
    REST APIs for form submission or user management
    Use standard coding + services (Java/Python API, Lambda, etc.)
```

## ✅ When to Use an AI/ML Model
```
Problem involves uncertainty, prediction, or pattern recognition
No clear rules — you need the model to “learn” from data

Examples:
    Predict customer churn or product demand
    Extract insights from documents (NLP/IDP)
    Analyze sentiment, classify images, recommend products
    Strategic tasks like content generation or forecasting
    Use ML/AI models (SageMaker, Bedrock, Comprehend, etc.)
```

## Conversation-1 
```
So now what I understood so there are lots of Machine learning models already exists 
    like IDP, Natural Language Processing, WaveNet, LLM, GAN And so many 
    help me list on all other models which I missed and most popular ones.
     
And  foundational model which are designed to adapt  
change and are more creative to generate new content
and under the hood relying on other models which were 
already built in past one or two decades.

So list down all the models On which foundational models relied on and 
Also tell me The Python library which I can use to connect with those models.
 
for example : There is a langchain Library to connect with LLM Model, so similarly do for rest
```
